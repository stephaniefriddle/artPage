            <img id="mainImg" src="images/pexels-luis-quintero-2471215.jpg" alt="Fluid Painting" width="100%" />
            <p class="summary">Fluid art is really diverse in technique and usable canvases. I'm just starting to explore it
            and have only done it on stretched canvases so far. I first tried it with a Meetup group a couple 
            years ago. This time I wanted something different and I'll be using some terricotta pots. I 
            wanted something to go out in the front of my home in this amazing armadillo frame planter I have. 
            I've spent a lot of time looking for something to put in him, but haven't found the right peice 
            that I want to spend the money on. So, I figured this would be a really great way to do some fluid 
            painting on. I love how the colors mix and swirl around with fluid painting.

                <h3>Step 1 - Get your materials together</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The canvas you're going to paint on - I'm using terricotta pots. I wanted to paint 
                            some pots for plants and got a couple different sizes. Terricotta pots are really 
                            cheap and I have a hard time finding ones in the stores I love and I think are 
                            worth the price. I also hate how they feel, so painting over them is perfect.</li>
                        <li>Acrylic paints - you can buy ones ready to go for fluid art, but you can also make 
                            your own for a lot cheaper. Keep in mind these will mix and swirl together, so 
                            choose colors that blend well together. I learned using white in the mix as well, 
                            although you don't see a lot of the white in the finished product.</li>
                        <li><a href=https://www.amazon.com/FLOOD-PPG-FLD6-04-Floetrol-Additive/dp/B000C029PM/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=floetrol&qid=1626119884&sr=8-6" 
                            target="_blank">FloeTrol</a> - this thins out the paint so it's more fluid. You can get it at home 
                            improvment stores</li>
                        <li><a href=https://www.amazon.com/3-ONE-Fast-Acting-Penetrant-Drip/dp/B00J25JD6Q/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=3-IN-ONE&qid=1626119833&sr=8-9"
                            target="_blank"> Silicone oil</a> - you only need a couple drops of this. You can find it at auto 
                            parts stores or home improvment stores. This is what helps creates cells - so if you're not a fan, no need to put it in!
                        </li>
                        <li>Containers to mix your paint in - I'm just using plastic cups</li>
                        <li>Mixers - I have some thick popcicle sticks to mix each color</li>
                        <li>A heat source - if you have a heat gun, use that. I don't, so I'm using a hair
                            dryer.</li>
                        <li>Work space protection - old newspapers laid out, that brown craft paper/packing material</li>
                        <li>Rubber gloves</li>
                        <li>An apron or some clothes you don't mind possibly getting paint on</li>
                    </ul>

            <div class="steps">
                <h3>Step 2 - Get your workspace in order</h3>
                <p>I like to have everything laid out and ready. You can use the extra paint that drips to make
                    more things too. So think coasters, key chains, things to cover in resin, etc. Just dip these in
                    your overflow paint for some bonus art! Make sure you have a place to let your art dry. Depending
                    how thick the paint is, it could take 2 or 3 days to fully dry.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="steps">
                <h3>Step 3 - Mix your paint</h3>
                <p>You're looking for a really runny solution here. It needs to flow around on your canvas. The consistancy you're
                    looking for is shown below. You'll add about a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio of paint and FloeTrol to your cup. Then 
                    you can add 7 to 10 drops of the Silicon if you choose to. Mix ALL your paint together before your start.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="steps">
                <h3>Step 4 - Decide on your painting technique</h3>
                <p>There's lots of techniques you can use. We decided to do a dirty pour because my 3 year old nephew was helping.
                    He told me which colors he wanted and I poured them all in a cup on top of each other. Then you take that cup
                    and pour it over your canvas. You get a lot of paint mixing together this way.
                </p>
                <img class="hideImages" src="images/step4.jpg" alt="Fluid Painting" width="100%" />
            </div>
            <div class="steps">
                <h3>Step 5 - Start painting!</h3>
                <p>Together we poured his cup of paint over the inside bottom rim of the pot so the paint dripped down the side of 
                    the pot. This technique ends up being rather unpredicable and the colors you add to the cup first are going to
                    be fairly prevalent. You can go color by color for a little more control over the colors as well.
                </p>
                <img class="hideImages" src="images/step5.jpg" alt="Fluid Painting" width="100%" />
            </div>
            <div class="steps">
                <h3>Step 6 - Let your colors flow</h3>
                <p>The whole idea is to let the colors flow with each other and cover your canvas. There's going 
                    to be a lot that drips down and pools. You can guide the paint by moving around your canvas or
                    gently spreading it out with a finger or tool to cover stubborn spots.
                </p>
                <img class="hideImages" src="images/step6.jpg" alt="Fluid Painting" width="100%" />
            </div>
            <div class="steps">
                <h3>Step 7 - You did it!</h3>
                <p>Once your canvas is completely covered, or however you want it, find a place to let it dry.
                    Keep in mind, the paint will still move and settle, and probably drip, so find a space that's
                    protected. 
                </p>
                <img class="hideImages" src="images/step7.jpg" alt="Fluid Painting" width="100%" />
            </div>
            <div class="steps">
                <h3>Step 8 - Do your extras</h3>
                <p>If you have extra items, now is the time to paint them. Just dip them in your pile of overflow
                    paint and lift up and behold your "free" creation!
                </p>
                <p>In my case, we did the pot trays. I had some extra paint in my cup we poured in the center, but then
                    we rolled the outside edge in our pool of extra paint.
