            <h1>Fluid Art on Pots</h1>
            <img src="images/pexels-luis-quintero-2471215.jpg" alt="Fluid Painting" width="100%" />
            <p class="summary">Fluid art is really diverse in technique and usable canvases. I'm just starting to explore it
            and have only done it on stretched canvases so far. I first tried it with a Meetup group a couple 
            years ago. This time I wanted something different and I'll be using some terricotta pots. I 
            wanted something to go out in the front of my home in this amazing armadillo frame planter I have. 
            I've spent a lot of time looking for something to put in him, but haven't found the right peice 
            that I want to spend the money on. So, I figured this would be a really great way to do some fluid 
            painting on. I love how the colors mix and swirl around with fluid painting.

                <h3>Step 1 - Get your materials together</h3>
                    <ul><!-- Is a list the best idea here, or should I choose something else? -->
                        <li>The canvas you're going to paint on - I'm using terricotta pots. I wanted to paint 
                            some pots for plants and got a couple different sizes. Terricotta pots are really 
                            cheap and I have a hard time finding ones in the stores I love and I think are 
                            worth the price. I also hate how they feel, so painting over them is perfect.</li>
                        <li>Acrylic paints - you can buy ones ready to go for fluid art, but you can also make 
                            your own for a lot cheaper. Keep in mind these will mix and swirl together, so 
                            choose colors that blend well together. I learned using white in the mix as well, 
                            although you don't see a lot of the white in the finished product.</li>
                        <li><a href=https://www.amazon.com/FLOOD-PPG-FLD6-04-Floetrol-Additive/dp/B000C029PM/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=floetrol&qid=1626119884&sr=8-6" 
                            target="_blank">FloeTrol</a> - this thins out the paint so it's more fluid. You can get it at home 
                            improvment stores</li>
                        <li><a href=https://www.amazon.com/3-ONE-Fast-Acting-Penetrant-Drip/dp/B00J25JD6Q/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=3-IN-ONE&qid=1626119833&sr=8-9"
                            target="_blank"> Silicone oil</a> - you only need a couple drops of this. You can find it at auto 
                            parts stores or home improvment stores. This is what helps creates cells - so if you're not a fan, no need to put it in!
                        </li>
                        <li>Containers to mix your paint in - I'm just using plastic cups</li>
                        <li>Mixers - I have some thick popcicle sticks to mix each color</li>
                        <li>A heat source - if you have a heat gun, use that. I don't, so I'm using a hair
                            dryer.</li>
                        <li>Work space protection - old newspapers laid out, that brown craft paper/packing material</li>
                        <li>Rubber gloves</li>
                        <li>An apron or some clothes you don't mind possibly getting paint on</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Step 2 - Get your workspace in order</h3>
                <p>I like to have everything laid out and ready. You can use the extra paint that drips to make
                    more things too. So think coasters, key chains, things to cover in resin. Just dip these in
                    your overflow paint for some bonus art!

            <div class="steps">
                <h3>Step 3 - Mix your paint</h3>
                <p>You're looking for a really runny solution here. You want to add a couple tablespoons of FloTrol
                    to your cup of paint and 7 to 8 drops of the Silicon. Mix ALL your paint together before your 
                    start.
                </p>

            <div class="steps">
                <h3>Step 4 - Get your canvas placed and ready</h3>
                <p>If you're doing multiple, you'll need space for each one to dry. You can use the same pouring
                    space if you don't mind some mixing on the bottom edge.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="steps">
                <h3>Step 5 - Start painting!</h3>
                <p>There's lots of techniques you can use. You can do a dirty pour - pouring your colors in a cup
                    and then turning that upside down and letting everything flow out. You can go color by color
                    for a little more control as well.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="steps">
                <h3>Step 6 - Let your colors flow</h3>
                <p>The whole idea is to let the colors flow with each other and cover your canvas. There's going 
                    to be a lot that drips down and pools. You can guide the paint by moving around your canvas or
                    gently spreading it out with a finger or tool to cover stubborn spots.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="steps">
                <h3>Step 7 - You did it!</h3>
                <p>Once your canvas is completely covered, or however you want it, find a place to let it dry.
                    Keep in mind, the paint will still move and settle, and probably drip, so find a space that's
                    protected. The paint can get pretty thick, so I'd give it at least 48 hours to dry.

            <div class="steps">
                <h3>Step 8 - Do your extras</h3>
                <p>If you have extra items, now is the time to paint them. Just dip them in your pile of overflow
                    paint and lift up and behold your "free" creation!
