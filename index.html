      <p>This is where I give a project summary.</p>
      <p>Here's the steps I followed</p>
    </div>
    <div class="steps">
        <h3>Step 1 - Get your materials together</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The canvas you're going to paint on - I'm using terricotta pots. I wanted to paint 
                    some pots for plants and got a couple different sizes. Terricotta pots are really 
                    cheap and I have a hard time finding ones in the stores I love and I think are 
                    worth the price. I also hate how they feel, so painting over them is perfect.</li>
                <li>Acrylic paints - you can buy ones ready to go for fluid art, but you can also make 
                    your own for a lot cheaper. Keep in mind these will mix and swirl together, so 
                    choose colors that blend well together. I learned using white in the mix as well, 
                    although you don't see a lot of the white in the finished product.</li>
                <li>FloTrol - this thins out the paint so it's more fluid. You can get it at home 
                    improvment stores</li>
                <li>Silicon - you only need a couple drops of this. You can find it at auto parts stores</li>
                <li>Containers to mix your paint in - I'm just using plastic cups</li>
                <li>Mixers - I have some thick popcicle sticks to mix each color</li>
                <li>A heat source - if you have a heat gun, use that. I don't, so I'm using a hair
                    dryer.</li>
                <li>Work space protection - old newspapers laid out, that brown craft paper/packing material</li>
                <li>Rubber gloves</li>
                <li>An apron or some clothes you don't mind possibly getting paint on</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2 - Get your workspace in order.</h3>
        <p>I like to have everything laid out and ready. You can use the extra paint that drips to make
            more things too. So think coasters, key chains, things to cover in resin. Just dip these in
            your overflow paint for some bonus art!
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3 - Mix your paint</h3>
        <p>You're looking for a really runny solution here. You want to add a couple tablespoons of FloTrol
            to your cup of paint and 7 to 8 drops of the Silicon. Mix ALL your paint together before your 
            start.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 4 - Get your canvas placed and ready</h3>
        <p>If you're doing multiple, you'll need space for each one to dry. You can use the same pouring
            space if you don't mind some mixing on the bottom edge.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 5 - Start painting!</h3>
        <p>There's lots of techniques you can use. You can do a dirty pour - pouring your colors in a cup
            and then turning that upside down and letting everything flow out. You can go color by color
            for a little more control as well.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 6 - Let your colors flow</h3>
        <p>The whole idea is to let the colors flow with each other and cover your canvas. There's going 
            to be a lot that drips down and pools. You can guide the paint by moving around your canvas or
            gently spreading it out with a finger or tool to cover stubborn spots.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 7 - You did it!</h3>
        <p>Once your canvas is completely covered, or however you want it, find a place to let it dry.
            Keep in mind, the paint will still move and settle, and probably drip, so find a space that's
            protected. The paint can get pretty thick, so I'd give it at least 48 hours to dry.
