This site was developed for consideration towards the completion of the Front End Web Development class of Code Louisville.

I chose to do this project because I wanted somewhere to reference previous art and techniques I've used. I also think it's a good way for others to learn a little bit about me as well. Eventually this page will be replaced with a real index page and moved to the 'Fluid Art' section and I will add in content to the other pages.

Two media queries are included with the break points at 550px and 900px with a mobile first perspective.

    -The first break point the hamburger menu changes to a horizontal list.
    -The second break point brings it from being a one column layout to a two column layout bringing the aside element 
    from the bottom of the page to the side of the page.

GitHub should show well over the 5 required commits.

CSS Features

    -My navigation menu is a hamburger menu for mobile and for tablet and desktop changes to a horizontal list.
    -I used Flexbox to change the layout from single column on mobile and table to two columns on desktop.

JavaScript Features

    -The images for the steps have a button that shows or hides them if you click it.
    -The hamburger menu was written with JavaScript to display the contents of that array.
